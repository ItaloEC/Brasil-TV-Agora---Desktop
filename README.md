> 🚨 Electron support is an experimental community project, so the workflow is suboptimal and subject to breaking changes. If you find bugs please report them on [expo/expo-electron-adapter](https://github.com/expo/expo-electron-adapter/issues).

[Electron][electron] is a framework for creating desktop apps that run in a Chromium wrapper. Using Expo with Electron will enable you to use your existing components to build OSX, Windows, and Linux apps.

## 🚀 How to use

- Run `yarn` or `npm install`
- Run `yarn expo-electron start`
- Wait until the web build is finished and Electron is started.
